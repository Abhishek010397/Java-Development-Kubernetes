# Kuberenetes-Operator-in-Java

Kubernetes Operators are software extensions to Kubernetes that make use of Custom Resources to manage applications and their components. They let you extend the clusterâ€™s behavior without modifying the code of Kubernetes itself. They are just clients of the Kubernetes API, which act as controllers of that Custom Resource.

In simple terms, a Kubernetes Operator is code that makes use of the Kubernetes API to execute some tasks; Custom Resources act as a configuration model on which that specific code acts.

I have Demonstarted the use of Operators in Kubernetes

Thereby to run hte project following components were used:-

1. Java 14 Version(OpenJDK)
2. mvn 3.x
3. Minikube was used
4. Intellij IDE

Here i have made use of a demo operator which implements a simple operator for a custom resource called PodSet which is somewhat equal to ReplicaSet.Each PodSet object would have 'x' number of replicas, so this operator just tries to maintain x number of replicas checking whether that number of pods are running in cluster or not.

To run the Project:-

1. kubectl apply -f crd.yaml
2. kubectl apply -f podset.yaml
3. mvn clean install
4. mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=io.fabric8.podset.operator.PodSetOperatorMain
