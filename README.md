# Kuberenetes-Operator-in-Java

Kubernetes Operators are software extensions to Kubernetes that make use of Custom Resources to manage applications and their components. They let you extend the clusterâ€™s behavior without modifying the code of Kubernetes itself. They are just clients of the Kubernetes API, which act as controllers of that Custom Resource.

In simple terms, a Kubernetes Operator is code that makes use of the Kubernetes API to execute some tasks; Custom Resources act as a configuration model on which that specific code acts.
